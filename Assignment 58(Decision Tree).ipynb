    "Q1. Describe the decision tree classifier algorithm and how it works to make predictions.\n",

    "ANS-  A decision tree classifier is a supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used to make predictions. It works by creating a tree-like \n",

    "To make a prediction, the decision tree classifier starts at the root node and follows the branches of the tree until it reaches a leaf node. \n",
